# IAED - Project 1

The first project in the IAED class (Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures) aimed to develop a command-line-based Kanban Board system.

The project was implemented using the C programming language and provided a practical exploration of fundamental concepts such as sorting algorithms, algorithmic efficiency, and the use of C data structures.
