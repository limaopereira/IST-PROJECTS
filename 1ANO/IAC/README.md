# ICA - Project

The project in ICA class (Introduction to Computer Architecture) involves the development of a very simple game, which is a simplified version of the Dino game that appears in the Chrome browser when there is no internet connection.

This project was implemented using Assembly language for the P4 architecture and aimed to provide hands-on experience with low-level programming concepts.
