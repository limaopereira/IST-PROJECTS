# SE - Project

The project in SE class (Software Engineering) aimed to enhance the existing 'Quizzes Tutor' application, which serves as a management and creation tool for multiple-choice questions.

The primary objective of this project was to enrich the dashboard significantly by incorporating additional statistics related to students, quizzes, and questions.

The project used Java, Spring Boot, Vue.js, pgSQL, Spock, JMeter, and Cypress, and explored fundamental software engineering concepts, including Domain Modeling, Persistence, Unit testing, Service Layer, Data Transfer Objects, End-To-End Testing and Load Testing.
