# SAM - Project

The project in the SAM class (Systems Analysis and Modeling) aimed to create a robust architectural representation of the PICKTRU product. This representation serves as the foundation for developing two distinct views: one tailored to inform business-level stakeholders and another designed to provide detailed insights for technology-level stakeholders.

This project was implemented using the Enterprise Architect Software.
