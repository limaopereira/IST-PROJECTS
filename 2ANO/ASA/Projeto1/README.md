# ASA - Project 1

The first project in ASA (Analysis and Synthesis of Algorithms) focused on solving two algorithmic problems:

- Calculating the size of the longest strictly increasing subsequence and determining the number of strictly increasing subsequences;

- Finding the size of the longest strictly increasing common subsequence between two subsequences.

Both solutions were implemented in C++.
