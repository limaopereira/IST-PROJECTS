# ASA - Project 2

The second project in ASA (Analysis and Synthesis of Algorithms) focused on solving an algorithmic problem, determining whether a given directed graph forms a genealogical tree and in such cases, identify the set of closest common ancestors between two given vertices.

The solution was implemented in C++.
